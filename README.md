*the code for an electronic circuit board with 6 servo motors using a simulation software:

cpp
// Include necessary libraries
#include <Servo.h>

// Define variables
Servo servo1, servo2, servo3, servo4, servo5, servo6;
int servo1_pin = 2, servo2_pin = 3, servo3_pin = 4, servo4_pin = 5, servo5_pin = 6, servo6_pin = 7;

void setup() {
  // Attach the servo motors to their respective pins
  servo1.attach(servo1_pin);
  servo2.attach(servo2_pin);
  servo3.attach(servo3_pin);
  servo4.attach(servo4_pin);
  servo5.attach(servo5_pin);
  servo6.attach(servo6_pin);
}

void loop() {
  // Move the servo motors to their maximum position
  servo1.write(180);
  servo2.write(180);
  servo3.write(180);
  servo4.write(180);
  servo5.write(180);
  servo6.write(180);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second

  // Move the servo motors to their minimum position
  servo1.write(0);
  servo2.write(0);
  servo3.write(0);
  servo4.write(0);
  servo5.write(0);
  servo6.write(0);
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
}


This code does the following:

1. Includes the Servo.h library, which provides the necessary functions to control the servo motors.
2. Defines 6 Servo variables to represent the servo motors.
3. In the setup() function:
   - The servo motor pins are attached using the attach() function.
4. In the loop() function:
   - Each servo motor is moved to the maximum position (180 degrees) and then waits for 1 second.
   - Then, each servo motor is moved to the minimum position (0 degrees) and waits for 1 second.
   - This process will repeat continuously in the loop() function.

You can modify the code to change the rotation angles or add more complex control logic as needed. This example provides a good starting point for building an electronic circuit board with 6 servo motors.
